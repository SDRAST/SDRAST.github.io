Organization RadioAstronomy
===========================

This repository contains an overview of the repositories in the RadioAstronomy
organization.  The main purpose is to host the web pages which describe how the
repository collection is structured.  The repositories contain mainly Python
packages.  Python code using these packages implicitly requires a specific
directory structure for the `import` statements to work.
