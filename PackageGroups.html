    <H3 ALIGN=center>Python Classes and Modules</H3>
    <P>
        A natural way to organize Python modules is to put the most general
        classes in modules at or near the top of a directory tree and the
        subclasses lower down, depending on what superclasses they inherit from.
    </P>
    <P>
        In an application one generally needs a few subclasses and then the
        classes from which they inherit attributes.  The modules required for the
        <TT>import</TT> statements trace a lines from the tips of a few branches
        to the trunk of the package directory tree.
    </P>
    <P>
        In a special purpose controller, a problem arises in trying to copy only
        the code needed for a single application.  If the entire tree is in one
        Github repository, a <TT>clone</TT> would bring in lots of code that is
        not needed.  This is inefficient and complicates code management.
        We need a scheme in which the imports of all the classes minimizes the
        implicit imports of unnecessary classes.
    </P>
    <P>
      Git does not support partial <TT>clone</TT>.  This results in a large
      number of repositories, basically one for each functional group of code,
      which may still include several modules.  One can see this, for example,
      at the <A HREF="https://github.com/ska-sa">SKA Github</A>.  From looking
      at this collection, it isn't easy to see what needs to be cloned for a
      given purpose without examining code and inspecting repos.
    </P>

    <H3 ALIGN=center>Managing Python under Github</H3>
    <P>One can make it easier to identify the repos needed by having a naming
      scheme that implies a hierarchy. To preserve uniformity among the DSN
      radio astronomy hosts we need to agree on a file system hierarchy and
      naming convention.  In general, the Git repository name will not be the
      same as the local working directory. At best it will be the base name
      of a hyphen-separated string.  This leads to some rules, namely
      <OL>
        <LI> If we are going to have a directory naming convention then the
          directory name and position in the filesystem should be in
          <TT>README.md</TT> of the repo.</LI>
        <LI>Sub-directories in the working directory of a repository may only
          contain code that is <UL>always</UL> required by the parent
          directory. If the same effect can be achieved with files in the
          working directory, that is preferred.</LI>
      </OL>
