    <H2 ALIGN=center>Repository Management</H2>

    The software for operation of an observatory requires a large number of
    packages, assuming that they aren't all lumped together in one huge repo.
    The <A HREF="https://github.com/ska-sa">SKA Github</A> in South Africa
    illustrates this.  It also illustrates how hard it is, from looking at the
    repo collection, what repos you would need for a specific purpose.

    As discussed further in <A HREF="PackageGroups.html">Python Packages in
    Github</A>, we use a naming scheme that reflects the directory structure
    of the Python packages.  The trunk of the directory tree is contained in
    repos with a single name, such as <TT>MonitorControl</TT> and
    <TT>Electronics</TT>.

    <H3 ALIGN=center>MonitorControl</H3>
    
    This package provides Monitor and Control functions for DSN
    Radio Astronomy.  It will replace much of what is now in
    <TT>site-packages/Observatory</TT>.<BR/>

    <H3 ALIGN=center>Electronics</H3>

    This package provides functions for DSN operating standard instruments and
    their bus interfaces.  It will replace code that is now also in
    <TT>site-packages/Observatory</TT>.<BR/>
